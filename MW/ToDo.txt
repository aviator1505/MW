Reading Loop



Space to continue
    event.waitKeys('space')



to implement trials, create different stimuli lists with the filenames stored as strings,
then make a for loop that iterates over the given list. DUH?

The current problem with the loop is that the script is awaiting the spacebar before prompting me to press i or u.
In other words, it will not display the intentionality prompt until I finish the loop


The loop must satisfy the following conditions:
    - space should end the loop and make it move on to the next item.
    - when mw is reported via 1 and i,u, after the latter is pressed, the screen should return
    to the current text page.
    It should only advance to the next page when space is pressed.
